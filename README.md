The Attack board game

I plan to fork TripleA - [TripleA](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea) is a turn based strategy game and board game engine, similar to Axis & Allies or Risk.


The game of Attack! is a very simple board game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era.
If you are a game player who enjoys simple rules, then this game is for you. 
The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.
